Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. As a result of climate change, droughts have become more frequent, weather patterns have been disturbed, natural disasters are more likely, the ozone layer has been damaged, and global inequality has grown. There is loss of ice, accelerated sea-level rise, glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is melting earlier. Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, majorly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84941777/171765661-2b37d850-53da-486f-a882-f68bc6511f92.png)
